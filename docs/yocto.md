The WiiPiiDo has support for [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/),
we created an BSP Layer, which can be found at <a class="fa fa-github" href="https://github.com/Globaltronic/meta-wiipiido"></a>.

!!! warning
    The Yocto support is still in it's early states, if you are not familiar with Yocto,
    or want something more stable, we recommend you to use the [Armbian image](getting-started.md).
