Through Armbian, the WiiPiiDo can be used either as a desktop-alike image, or as a server image. This way, it it possible to use the WiiPiiDo in the following ways: Using the console through the serial port Using the console through SSH Using a desktop environment Independently of the method used to use the board, the login credentials are: username: pi password: wiipido Connect through the Serial Interface To connect to the console using the serial interface, you need to have a USB to Serial connector, by connecting it from the host PC's USB port to the WiiPiiDo's Serial connection highlighted in the following image: The WiiPiiDo baud rate is set to 115200 , so, once connected to Linux machine you can use the picocom program to connect use the serial console, as follow: $ picocom -b 115200 <serial_port> In Windows, the program Putty can be used for this effect as well. Connect through SSH To connect to the WiiPiiDo through SSH you first need to know it's IP address. This can be found by either using a network scanner program, like Fing , or by configuring the WiiPiiDo to have a static and known IP, when connected to it using another method. When the IP address is known, you can login to the WiiPiiDo, in a Linux machine by using the following command $ ssh pi@<wiipiido_ip_address> . Alternately, in Windows, you can use once again, for example Putty . Activate/Deactivate the Desktop Environment To activate and deactivate the desktop environment that comes by default, you can simply enable/disable the display manager that is being used, which in this case is LightDM . To do this, you can run the following commands in the console. # Enable the desktop environment $ systemctl enable lightdm.service $ systemctl start lightdm.service # Enable the desktop environment $ systemctl stop lightdm.service $ systemctl disable lightdm.service After rebooting the board, the desktop environment will be active/inactive.","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#connect-through-the-serial-interface","text":"To connect to the console using the serial interface, you need to have a USB to Serial connector, by connecting it from the host PC's USB port to the WiiPiiDo's Serial connection highlighted in the following image: The WiiPiiDo baud rate is set to 115200 , so, once connected to Linux machine you can use the picocom program to connect use the serial console, as follow: $ picocom -b 115200 <serial_port> In Windows, the program Putty can be used for this effect as well.","title":"Connect through the Serial Interface"},{"location":"getting-started/#connect-through-ssh","text":"To connect to the WiiPiiDo through SSH you first need to know it's IP address.
